 # Basic Login/Register App

In this project I used react for frontend, node.js for backend and MongoDB for DB.

## To run the project

### 1. Install dependecies.

For frontend
``` 
cd frontend
npm install

cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. DB connection
   
For the connection, fisrt of all you should download mongodb desktop app. The create a DB that called "Employee". Your DB connect at "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/".
